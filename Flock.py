# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The code below keeps track of a flock of birds for a bird 
# simulation.  It inherits from class 'System'.
#
#   __init__ : construct a flock of birds of a specified subclass
#   registerLeader: for EXERCISE 4
#   registerPredator: for EXERCISE 5
#

    #
    # Create a new instance with 'size' new birds, with each being
    # an instance of class 'class'. These all get added to the 
    # world 'world'.
